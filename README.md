This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
And I have added the material -ui as dependency.

To try this project you have to pull it from github.
In project directory you have to run: 

### `npm install`

After installation, if you wish to start project you must run:

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
